# Configure Single Sign-On

NOTE: `bigbang.dev` is the default domain. If you are using a different domain, substitute `bigbang.dev` for your domain in all URLs

## Configure GitLab

1. Retrieve the initial root password for GitLab:

    ```shell
    kubectl get secret gitlab-gitlab-initial-root-password -n gitlab -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
    ```

3. Navigate to [https://gitlab.bigbang.dev](https://gitlab.bigbang.dev)

4. Log in using username `root` with the password retrieved from the previous step

5. Navigate to [https://gitlab.bigbang.dev/-/profile/password/edit](https://gitlab.bigbang.dev/-/profile/password/edit) and change the root password. Save the new password as you will need it in disaster recovery scenarios.

6. [OPTIONAL] Disable Sign-up in the Sign-up restrictions section on [https://gitlab.bigbang.dev/admin/application_settings/general](https://gitlab.bigbang.dev/admin/application_settings/general). If you disable it you will need to manually create all new users. It may be advantageous to leave it on, since you can require admin approval for new sign-ups. Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the section.

7. Enable "Enforce two-factor authentication" in the Sign-in restrictions section on [https://gitlab.bigbang.dev/admin/application_settings/general](https://gitlab.bigbang.dev/admin/application_settings/general). Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the section.

8. Configure two-factor authentication on the root account. Make sure this gets done right away. If you wait past the grace period the root account will be locked out.

### Configure Jenkins

**Warnings and notes**

- :warning: WARNING: This section involves committing and pushing a secret to your config repo. The file needs to be encrypted with SOPS before you push it to your repo. See the [SOPS guide](sops.md) for instructions.

- NOTE: Configuring Jenkins to use GitLab as the SSO provider will not work when using the `bigbang.dev` domain. During the OAuth ping-pong auth flow Jenkins tries to run a POST http request to get a login token, but it isn't able to hit `https://gitlab.bigbang.dev` since that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. This may be fixable through the use of an Istio [ServiceEntry](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/service-entry/). More investigation needed.

#### Instructions

1. Navigate to [https://gitlab.bigbang.dev/admin/applications/new](https://gitlab.bigbang.dev/admin/applications/new) and create a new Application for Jenkins. Click "Save application" when finished.
   1. Name: `Jenkins`
   2. Redirect URI: `https://jenkins.bigbang.dev/securityRealm/finishLogin`
   3. Trusted: Yes (checked)
   4. Confidential: Yes (checked)
   5. Expire access tokens: Yes (checked)
   6. Scopes: "api" checked, all others unchecked

1. Copy/Paste the Application ID and Secret from Gitlab into your config repo in the file `kustomizations/softwarefactoryaddons/jenkins/environment-bb-values.yaml` in the parameters that say `YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` AND `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE`

1. :warning: Encrypt `kustomizations/softwarefactoryaddons/jenkins/environment-bb-values.yaml` with SOPS. See the [SOPS guide](sops.md) for instructions.

    ```shell
    sops -e -i kustomizations/softwarefactoryaddons/jenkins/environment-bb-values.yaml
    ```

1. Commit and push the changes to your config repo

1. Create a "Day 2" package and deploy it. This package contains nothing but your config repo, so that Gitea will receive the new commit that you just pushed. For convenience, there is a Makefile in that repo

    ```shell
    cd day2
    zarf package create --confirm
    
    # Sneakernet the package if you need to

    zarf package deploy zarf-package-day-two-update-amd64.tar.zst --confirm
    ```

After Flux reconciles the change, Jenkins should now be using GitLab as the SSO provider.

### Configure Jira

1. Navigate to [https://jira.bigbang.dev](https://jira.bigbang.dev)

1. Set up Jira. This guide will use the "I'll set it up myself" option. Click "I'll set it up myself" then click Next

1. Use "Built In" for database connection. (Note: For eval purposes only. In production, Jira needs to use an external database)
